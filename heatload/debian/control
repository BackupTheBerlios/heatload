Description: Graphical and numerical ACPI- and CPU-load-monitor applet for X11
 This Gtk utility produces nice looking realtime graphs for the
 current CPU-load and some ACPI-values (eg. temperature, battery) of your
 Linux machine. It is nice for monitoring the direct relation of 
 the former to the latter.
