heatload (0.3.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split debian-part to separate diff. This is no native package.
  * clean up debian/rules:
     -don't call auto{conf,make}.
      results of autoconf, et.al.should be shipped by upstream in
      orig.tar.gz or at least by the debian-maintaner in the diff, to
      keep build-depends small and work around the famous "No version of 
      automake is compatible with any other"-problem.
     - fix clean. it failed if clean was called without config.status,...
  * correct build-depends.
  * Typos in package-description.
