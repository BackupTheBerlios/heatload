This Gnome utility produces nice looking realtime graphs for the
current CPU load and ACPI temperature of your Linux machine. It is
nice for monitoring the direct relation of the former to the latter.

The reason I developed this program was that the ACPI implementation
of my laptop seems to be broken, and I needed a simple way to
determine when the machines became too hot.

Requirements
------------

As of version 0.1 you need a Linux kernel 2.4 with a fairly recent
ACPI patch. (I used 20020308) Without this patch, the utility will not
recognize your temperature sensor. Starting with 0.2, I added support
for plain 2.4.18-Kernels (and some kernel versions prior) with ACPI
20011018 based on a patch by Ian Morgan. lm_sensor-devices are not
supported. (Somebody wants to send me a patch?)

For compiling you need a recent g++ with Gtk-- and Gnome--
installed. I did my development with 1.2.8 resp. 1.2.2.

Development
-----------

Development was done under Debian GNU Linux Woody for i386 from March
2002. The used machine was a Medion 9580-F laptop.

[Malte:]
Debian GNU Linux sid from December 2002 on an Sony Vaio FX505

Installation
------------

Run "make" for compiling the program. You might want to install it
permanently on your system by issuing "make install" as root. This
install the heatload executable to /usr/local/bin/. For removing this
installation you might want to try "make deinstall" as root.
